Problem Statement
COVID-19(Coronavirus disease) is a highly contagious disease, and the WHO(World Health Organization) and other health agencies have recommended that people use face masks to prevent its transmission. All governments are attempting to guarantee that face masks are worn in public places, but it is difficult to manually identify those who are not wearing face masks in crowded places.
One of the health protocols, especially masks, can prevent transmission; stated in research6 the use of masks by the community is an effort to reduce the risk of infection caused by pathogens that stick to the hands and face and fly in the air. This is also in line with the statement8 that the use of face masks is designated as a non-pharmaceutical intervention that has the potential to be very effective in inhibiting the spread of COVID-19.
Face masks have played an important role in protecting health workers and the general public by reducing the incidence of infection through airborne transmission. Face masks worn by patients can reduce the release of virus-carrying droplets into the open air and the inhalation of virus-carrying droplets from the open air.
Compliance with the use of masks is highly dependent on public awareness to protect themselves and others. Public awareness of using masks in public is still very lacking, this is due to the general perception that evidence to support the use of masks still lacks, especially for the general public in the community. Many factors, including unfamiliarity, impracticality cause of non-compliance with the use of masks, must be purchased.

SOLUTION:
The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the critical importance of wearing face masks as a preventive measure to curb the spread of the virus. To ensure public safety and compliance with face mask mandates, there is a growing need for efficient and automated systems that can accurately detect individuals wearing or not wearing masks in various settings such as public places, workplaces, and transportation hubs. This abstract presents an overview of a face mask detection system, a technological solution aimed at monitoring and enforcing face mask usage.
The proposed face mask detection system employs computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to analyze images captured from surveillance cameras or other sources. The system's primary objective is to detect faces and determine whether they are wearing masks or not, automated enforcement of face mask policies.
